# Prompts You Can Try

This document lists example prompts you can use to test obs-mcp when connected to Cursor or another MCP client. These prompts align with the [MCPChecker evals](../../evals/mcpchecker/) and exercise different obs-mcp tools.

For metric discovery tips (e.g. regex behavior, common question → metric mapping), see [METRICS_REFERENCE.md](./METRICS_REFERENCE.md).

## Metric Discovery

- List all available Prometheus metrics that contain 'kube' in the name.
- What node-related metrics are available in Prometheus?

## Label Exploration

- What labels are available for the kube_pod_info metric?
- What are the unique namespace values for the kube_pod_info metric?
- How many time series exist for the kube_pod_info metric? Show the cardinality.

## Queries

- Which pods are using the most CPU?
- Which pods are stuck in pending state?
- Which pods are receiving the most network traffic?
- How many head series does Prometheus have?
- What is the current storage size of the Prometheus WAL?
- How many requests per second are being made to Prometheus?
- How many pods were created in the last 5 minutes?
- Which pods were crashlooping in the last 5 minutes?

## Alerts

- Are there any currently firing alerts in the cluster? Prefer `list_alerts` when the alert-management toolset is enabled.
- Are there any active silences in Alertmanager? (`get_silences`)
- Silence alert `WidgetDown` in namespace `my-app` for two hours because of a maintenance window.
- Expire the silence that is muting `WidgetDown`.
- Check if there are any firing alerts. If there are, investigate the related metrics for the most critical alert and summarize what's happening.

## Alert rule management

Requires `--toolsets` to include `observability/alert-management`. See [ALERT_MANAGEMENT.md](../ALERT_MANAGEMENT.md). The agent should list and preview, then ask before writing.

- Disable then restore a platform alert with `update_alert_rule` and `alerting_rule_enabled` (do not delete the rule).
- List user-defined alert rules in namespace `my-app`.
- Create an alert named `WidgetDown` with expr `up{job="widget"} == 0` and severity `critical` in PrometheusRule `user-alerts` in `my-app`. If a rule with that expression already exists, ask before creating another.
- Update the severity of alert `WidgetDown` to `warning`. If more than one rule has that name, ask which one.
- This Watchdog rule is GitOps-managed. How do I change it?

## Multi-Step Investigation

These prompts are part of the eval suite (hard difficulty) and test complex reasoning:

- Which namespace is consuming the most CPU and memory? Show me the top namespace for each.
- Is the cluster healthy? Give me an overview of any issues.

## Bonus: Additional Prompts

These prompts go beyond the eval suite and test more complex workflows:

- What's the memory usage of pods in the monitoring namespace?
- Show me the container restart count for all pods over the last hour.
- Which nodes have the highest CPU utilization?
- What's the disk usage on the cluster nodes?
- Are any containers in OOMKilled state?
- How many pods are running in the cluster?
