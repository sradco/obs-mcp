# Deployment Guide

This guide covers authentication modes and deploying obs-mcp on Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters.

## Quickstart Developer Setup

The easiest way to get everything up and running for development is to leverage the e2e setup
scripts:

```bash
# for local kind-based deployment
export E2E_PROFILE=kind
# or when running against openshift cluster
# export E2E_PROFILE=openshift
make test-e2e-setup && make test-e2e-deploy && make test-e2e
```

This setup configures all dependencies, as well as the obs-mcp deployment itself.

To use the remote deployment locally, you can port-forward the MCP service with

```bash
make test-e2e-pf
```

These make targets leverage the `setup.sh` script. See [using the setup script](#using-the-setup-script) below for more details.

### Running locally

To run the server locally against the backends from the cluster:

```bash
E2E_PROFILE=kind  # or openshift
make test-e2e-run
```

This command will open all necessary port-forwards to the backends running in
the test cluster.

## Authentication Modes

The `--auth-mode` flag controls how obs-mcp obtains bearer tokens for **Prometheus/Thanos**, **Alertmanager**, and (when enabled) **Loki**, **Tempo**, and **monitoring-plugin alert management API** endpoints:

| Mode             | Token Source                                                                 | Use Case                                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kubeconfig`     | Bearer token from `~/.kube/config` or mounted service account token          | Local development or in-cluster deployment                |
| `header`         | Forwarded from incoming MCP request's `Authorization` header                 | Pass-through auth or when Prometheus doesn't require auth |

### `kubeconfig` mode

- Extracts the bearer token from your local kubeconfig or from the mounted service account token file
- **Auto-discovers** Prometheus/Thanos routes in OpenShift (only mode with auto-discovery)
- Requires token-based auth (`oc whoami -t` must return a token when running locally)
- Best for: **Local development** when logged into a cluster, or **in-cluster deployment** on OpenShift with RBAC-protected Thanos/Prometheus

### `header` mode

- Forwards the `Authorization` header from incoming MCP client requests to Prometheus
- If no header is provided, connects without authentication
- Requires explicit `PROMETHEUS_URL` (no auto-discovery)
- If `observability/logs` toolset is enabled, either set `LOKI_URL`/`--loki-url` or use LokiStack discovery parameters (`lokiNamespace`, `lokiName`)
- If `observability/alert-management` toolset is enabled, set `ALERT_MGMT_API_URL`/`--alert-mgmt-api-url` (required in `header` mode; kubeconfig mode falls back to `https://localhost:9443`). Use HTTPS so the caller's token is forwarded; `http://` backends never receive bearer tokens. Kind e2e does not install monitoring-plugin; alert-management calls skip when the API is missing. Tool workflow and GitOps behavior: [ALERT_MANAGEMENT.md](ALERT_MANAGEMENT.md).
- OpenShift sample RBAC (`obs-mcp-monitoring-reader`) is metrics/Alertmanager **read** plus Prometheus query. Silence writes and `AlertRelabelConfig` (platform drop/restore) are not in that role; bind extra Roles to the caller (e2e does this for the obs-mcp service account).
- Best for: **Pass-through auth** scenarios or **Prometheus without authentication** (e.g., port-forwarded, local kube-prometheus)

## Deploying on a Cluster

Example manifests are provided in the `manifests/` directory, organised by stack:

- `manifests/core/deploy/kubernetes/` — Core MCP server for Kubernetes (apply with `kubectl apply -k`)
- `manifests/core/deploy/openshift/` — Core MCP server for OpenShift (apply with `kubectl apply -k`)
- `manifests/prometheus/deploy/kubernetes/` — NetworkPolicies for kube-prometheus access
- `manifests/prometheus/deploy/openshift/` — RBAC for OpenShift monitoring access
- `manifests/tempo/deploy/` — Tracing RBAC (platform-independent)
- `manifests/loki/deploy/` — Loki RBAC (platform-independent)

These are **reference examples** that you'll need to customize for your environment.

### Using the setup script

`hack/e2e/setup.sh` automates cluster setup for E2E testing and development. It accepts a
**profile**, a set of **stacks**, and a **phase expression**:

```bash
hack/e2e/setup.sh [PHASE_EXP] [--profile PROFILE] [--stacks STACKS]
```

**Profiles** select the target cluster type:

| Profile      | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `kind`       | Local [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster (default). Provisions and unprovisions the cluster automatically. |
| `k8s`        | Generic upstream Kubernetes cluster (must already exist).                                                         |
| `openshift`  | OpenShift cluster (must already exist). Uses `oc` instead of `kubectl`.                                           |

**Stacks** are optional observability backends that obs-mcp connects to. Pass a
comma-separated list via `--stacks` (default: `prometheus,tempo,loki`):

| Stack        | What it installs                                                       | Toolset enabled |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `prometheus` | kube-prometheus (k8s) or uses the built-in OpenShift monitoring stack  | `observability/metrics` and `observability/alert-management` |
| `tempo`      | Tempo + OpenTelemetry operators and a sample tracing app               | `observability/traces`  |
| `loki`       | Loki Operator test stack                                               | `observability/logs`    |

The enabled stacks determine which `manifests/` subtrees are applied and which `--toolsets`
value is passed to the obs-mcp deployment — no manual editing of manifests is needed.
When deploying via `hack/e2e/setup.sh`, the `observability/otelcol` toolset is always included (it has no
external backend dependency); stack selection adds `observability/metrics`, `observability/traces`, and/or `observability/logs` on top.
The prometheus stack also enables `observability/alert-management`. Kind does not deploy monitoring-plugin;
`list_alert_rules` and `list_alerts` e2e tests skip when that API is unreachable or returns 404 (stock monitoring-plugin). OpenShift uses the in-cluster monitoring-plugin service.

**Phases** express what work to perform. The two top-level aliases cover the common cases:

| Alias          | Expands to                                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `up` (default) | `provision` (kind only) → `prereqs` → `extras` → `upload` → `deploy`   |
| `down`         | `clean` → `unprovision` (kind only)                                    |

Individual phases can be named explicitly (space-separated) to re-run just part of the
sequence, e.g. `hack/e2e/setup.sh deploy --profile kind`:

| Phase          | Description                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provision`    | Creates the Kind cluster (kind profile only).                                                                                     |
| `prereqs`      | Installs cluster-wide operators and CRDs needed by the enabled stacks (cert-manager, Tempo/OTel operators, kube-prometheus CRDs). |
| `extras`       | Adds sources of observability signal for better e2e testing.                                                                      |
| `upload`       | Builds/loads or pushes the obs-mcp container image into the cluster.                                                              |
| `deploy`       | Deploys the obs-mcp to the cluster.                                                                                               |
| `clean`        | Removes temporary artefacts.                                                                                                      |
| `unprovision`  | Deletes the Kind cluster (kind profile only).                                                                                     |

**Manifests directory structure** mirrors the phases and stacks:

```shell
manifests/
├── core/$PHASE/{base,kubernetes,openshift}/    # common manifests for obs-mcp
└── $STACK/$PHASE/{base,kubernetes,openshift}/  # stack-specific manifests
```

### Key Configuration

When deploying in-cluster, you must configure:

1. **`PROMETHEUS_URL`**: Set the environment variable to your Prometheus/Thanos endpoint
2. **`LOKI_URL`**: Optional when using the `observability/logs` toolset (or pass `--loki-url`). If omitted, use LokiStack discovery (`loki_list_instances` + `lokiNamespace`/`lokiName` tool arguments)
3. **`--auth-mode`**: Choose based on your backend authentication requirements:
   - `kubeconfig` if your Prometheus requires RBAC/token auth
   - `header` if your Prometheus doesn't require authentication
4. **ServiceAccount RBAC**: If using `kubeconfig` mode in-cluster, ensure the ServiceAccount has permissions to query your metrics/logs endpoints

### Configuring the Prometheus URL

The metrics backend URL is determined in the following order:

1. `PROMETHEUS_URL` environment variable (if set, always used regardless of auth mode)
2. Route discovery via the OpenShift Route API (only in `kubeconfig` mode, respects `--metrics-backend`)
3. Fatal error — `header` mode requires `PROMETHEUS_URL` to be set explicitly

> [!NOTE]
>
> Auto-discovery only works in `kubeconfig` mode. For `header` mode, the server
> will fail at startup if `PROMETHEUS_URL` is not set. The same applies to `ALERTMANAGER_URL` when alert tools are used.

### Guardrails and Thanos Compatibility

obs-mcp includes query guardrails that prevent expensive or unsafe PromQL queries. Two guardrails rely on the `/api/v1/status/tsdb` endpoint:

| Guardrail                                                   | What it checks                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `max-metric-cardinality`                                    | Rejects queries against metrics with more series than the configured limit |
| `disallow-blanket-regex` (with `max-label-cardinality > 0`) | Rejects blanket regex matchers (`=~".+"`) on high-cardinality labels       |

**Thanos compatibility:**

- **Thanos v0.40.0+** (Oct 2025): The Query component exposes `/api/v1/status/tsdb` ([#8484](https://github.com/thanos-io/thanos/pull/8484)), so all guardrails work.
- **Thanos < v0.40.0**: The TSDB status endpoint is not available on the Query component. Use `--guardrails=none` or use the `!tsdb` shortcut to disable only the TSDB-dependent guardrails while keeping the others enabled:

  ```shell
  --guardrails='!tsdb'
  ```

- **Prometheus**: All guardrails work with any supported Prometheus version.
