## Alert Rule Management Workflow

This toolset lists OpenShift alert instances and manages alert rules via the monitoring-plugin management API.
It supports both in-console (Lightspeed) and non-console (Cursor, Claude, CLI) usage.

You must follow this workflow. Do not skip confirmation, and do not guess which rule to change.

### Choose the right action

Map the user's words before calling a write tool:
- mute, silence, or stop paging → create_silence on observability/metrics (Alertmanager). List silences with get_silences. This toolset has no silence write tools. If create_silence is not available, say so. Do not delete or drop a rule to mute notifications.
- list firing/pending/silenced instances → list_alerts (this toolset). get_alerts on observability/metrics is Alertmanager v2 and does not include management-API rule ids.
- disable or drop a platform alert → update_alert_rule with alerting_rule_enabled=false (platform rules only).
- restore a dropped platform alert → alerting_rule_enabled=true.
- remove a user-created rule → delete_alert_rules.
- change PromQL, alert name, for, or annotations → not update_alert_rule (see Update limits).

### Always discover first

1. Call list_alert_rules before create, update, or delete. That tool returns rule definitions. list_alerts returns firing, pending, or silenced instances and may include rule_id; get_alerts does not. Do not PATCH an id taken only from get_alerts without listing the rule. A non-empty rule_id from list_alerts is the stable id.
2. Identify rules by stable id (openshift_io_alert_rule_id). Alert name is not unique. If a listed rule has an empty id, do not invent one; explain that the rule cannot be updated or deleted through this API.
3. Show list_alert_rules and list_alerts warnings to the user.

### Create: choose platform vs user-defined; check for an existing expression

Omitting prometheus_rule_name creates a platform alerting rule. Setting prometheus_rule_name and namespace creates a user-defined rule in that PrometheusRule. Do not default to either, and do not invent a PrometheusRule name.

When the user asks to create a rule:
1. Choose the target from what they said. If they named a PrometheusRule and namespace, use those (user-defined). If they asked for a platform or cluster-monitoring rule, omit prometheus_rule_name. If it is unclear, ask before preview.
2. Call list_alert_rules (filter by namespace when the user named one).
3. Compare the proposed PromQL with each listed expr (ignore trivial whitespace).
4. If any existing rule has the same expression, stop. Show id, name, namespace, source, and management_status. Ask whether to update that rule, create a duplicate, or cancel. Do not call create_alert_rule unless the user explicitly chooses to create anyway. If they asked to change the expression of an existing rule, do not PATCH expr (unsupported); propose a replacement create or Git, after confirmation.
5. If observability/metrics is enabled, call list_metrics and confirm the expr's metric names exist before preview. Alert expr is not covered by PromQL query guardrails.
6. If none match: preview_alert_rule, explain the planned create (user-defined vs platform, and which PrometheusRule if any), and wait for the user to agree before create_alert_rule.

Do not put secrets, tokens, or passwords in labels or annotations.

### Update limits

update_alert_rule can only change labels, severity, classification, or drop/restore (alerting_rule_enabled).
It cannot change expr, alert name, for, or annotations.
alerting_rule_enabled (drop/restore) is platform-only. Do not set it on source=user rules.
Classification parameters are for platform rules. Do not use them on source=user rules unless the user explicitly asked to set those label keys.

### Update or delete by name: disambiguate

When the user names an alert (for example "update Watchdog") rather than an id:
1. Call list_alert_rules and keep every result whose name equals that alert name.
2. If zero matches, say so and stop.
3. If two or more match, stop. List each hit with id, name, namespace, expr, severity, source, and management_status. Ask which specific rule they mean. Do not pass every matching id. Do not update or delete all matches unless the user explicitly asks to change all of them and then confirms each action (or clearly confirms a bulk change of those ids).
4. If exactly one matches, still confirm before changing it.

### Confirm before any write

Before create_alert_rule, update_alert_rule, or delete_alert_rules:
1. Call preview_alert_rule (delete: describe the listed rule; preview is create/update only).
2. Explain in plain language what will change (name, id, namespace, fields, and which Kubernetes resources preview lists).
3. Stop and wait until the user explicitly agrees. A request like "update Watchdog" is not agreement to a specific patch.

### After update or delete

The HTTP call can succeed while individual rules fail. Read each per-rule statusCode and message and report failures. Do not claim overall success from the envelope alone.
After a label update, the stable id may change. Use the id returned in the result for any later call. Do not reuse the old id.

### GitOps-managed and operator-managed rules

If management_status is gitops, or preview returns writable=false with managedBy=gitops:
- Do not call create, update, or delete (the API rejects it).
- Tell the user the rule is GitOps-managed and this API cannot persist the change.
- Direct them to edit the owning PrometheusRule or AlertingRule in Git (the GitOps source of truth), commit, and let reconciliation apply it. Use the listed namespace, group, and name to identify the manifest.

If management_status is operator, or preview returns writable=false with managedBy=operator:
- Do not retry writes that preview marks not writable.
- Tell the user the rule is operator-managed. Persistent spec edits belong in the operator configuration, not this API. Notifications can be muted with create_silence (Alertmanager; observability/metrics).

Do not retry a 409/405 GitOps or operator-managed conflict.
Do not retry 400, 404, or 413; explain the error. A 403 means the caller lacks RBAC for that namespace or cluster scope; do not retry.

### Other rules

- Severity values: critical, warning, info, none.
- Authorization uses the caller's bearer token. Write tools are always registered; the management API enforces RBAC.
- Do not pass cluster or cluster_labels on create, update, delete, or preview.

Returns firing, pending, and/or silenced instances with labels, state, and rule_id when the API attached a stable id.
This is alert instances, not rule definitions (use list_alert_rules for expr and management_status).
Prefer this over get_alerts when you need a rule_id for update_alert_rule or delete_alert_rules.
Surface warnings from the response.

Optional filters: namespace, severity, state (pending, firing, silenced), source, cluster, cluster_labels, matchers, and extra label equality filters.`

	listAlertRulesPrompt = `List managed OpenShift alert rules from the monitoring-plugin management API.

Returns each rule's stable ID, PromQL expression, severity, namespace, source (platform or user), and management_status (user-created, gitops, or operator).
This is rule definitions, not firing instances (use list_alerts for those). Use this before create (to detect the same expr) and before update/delete (to resolve names to ids).
Alert name is not unique: if several rows share a name, present them to the user and wait; do not pick one or change all of them.
If id is empty, do not invent an id. Surface warnings from the response.
GitOps-managed and operator-managed rules cannot be updated or deleted through this API; explain that and point GitOps users at editing the rule in Git.

Do not put secrets in labels or annotations.
Do not pass cluster or cluster_labels on this operation.

Before calling this tool:
1. list_alert_rules and check whether any rule already has the same PromQL expression. If one does, ask the user whether to update that rule instead of creating a duplicate.
2. If observability/metrics is enabled, verify expr metric names with list_metrics.
3. preview_alert_rule for the create payload.
4. Explain the planned create (user-defined vs platform) and wait for the user to agree.

Do not retry a 409/405 GitOps or operator-managed conflict. If the target PrometheusRule is GitOps-managed, tell the user to add the alert in Git instead. Do not retry 400, 404, or 413.`
